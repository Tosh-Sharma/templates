# Intention of this Project

The following repository is meant to contain templates of codebases required to kickstart a project.

Often times, especially in the microservices world, one needs to create small services to handle small tasks.

The initial time of developers gets lost in setting up of Infrastructure and initial code base.

The intent of this library is to address those issues. While there is no automated infrastructure setup yet. I shall address this shortcoming in due course of time.
