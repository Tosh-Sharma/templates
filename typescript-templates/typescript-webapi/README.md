# About

The following repository is a basic template to kick start a TypeScript Project.

The following template uses [TSOA](https://github.com/lukeautry/tsoa/#table-of-contents) to a large extent to auto generate the Routes.ts and the Swagger.json file. It would be good to read about the library and it's internal workings/limitations before starting to use this template.
